    "complaintTitle": "How much do you make on an average 8 hour day driving for Uber x/lyft in Orlando?:Variables to consider, which is why there are always arguments on pay:  \n\\- What time(s) are you driving? Night time after clubs close? Solid pay. Higher risk of puking, however. Daytime hours? Depends on events in city/weather.  \n\\- How new are you? Uber likes to lure people in by giving their first month with GREAT pay and passengers.... after that, it's lower....  \n\\- Do you care about depreciation? Is your car a POS? Less stuff matters.  \n\\- Is smoking (both cigs and weed) an issue? Pay can be impacted depending on your situation.  \n\\- How many hours are you okay with per week? The post says 8 hr/day... 40 hours? 56 hours? Technically, the more you drive, the more you make although total weekly average hourly rate varies.  \n\n\n  \nThat said, personal exp DURING tail end of COVID: drove brand new hybrid for Lyft/Uber.  \nPay started out at 30+/hr. After 40 days, it was closer to $20/hr. My hours were 5AM-1PM. Did some random shifts at night to see what it was like. Pay varied a lot towards the end when I stopped. I almost got into a \"schedule\" by gaming the algorithm but after a week and a half of this \"schedule\" they purposely started sending me into dead end drop offs, so that's when I stopped.  \nWhile this was a year and a half ago, the stories are the same everywhere in the US. Still browse rideshare subreddits from time to time to see what's happening.  \n\"OMG great pay\" initially, then issues after \"honeymoon\" period.  \n\n\n  \nThe \"best\" play I've seen/heard is people buying used hybrid cars and running it into the ground. Good mileage in traffic and cuts gas by 20%-40% (depending on how slow you drive lol)  \nGood luck , poster.",

I have 256 (5-star) 2 (4 -star) and 2 (1-star). Common sense states you'd think, it's the rider, not the driver. If I had odds like that for Powerfully,  I'd be filthy rich. I think, if I suspect a low ball review, it's time to retaliate,  TP the house, spray paint, etc. When you mess with a person's livelihood, and you're a no-car-havin, low life, eating Cheeto's in mommy's basement all day, there needs to be payback. I note, some of those people just need to get a life and feel the pain. A Uber, Vigilante Squd",

    "desc": "Honestly, you’ll never really know why. Which is unfortunate because it doesn’t really give u an opportunity to understand it or correct it even if u could. Life is like that - you can do everything right and still, someone out there will always have an issue. That’s likely on them. \nIt’s like getting a 99% score or rating on a test or in a focus group, and focusing on that 1%. \nIf you go above and beyond to provide the best service (which it sounds like u have), then you’ve done all you can and so you should sleep well at night. \nAll this to say 2 things. \n1) you don’t know why u got the rating, and while u can guess, it’s not anything more than your speculation, so even if u could, IMO u shouldn’t contest / dispute it.  \n2) don’t let it get you down or make it ruin your day. There will always be a hater and often times, if it’s an anomaly, then it’s likely their issue not yours.",
